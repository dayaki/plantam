Implementation Plan for iOS Plant Placement App

Project Overview

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for the iOS Plant Placement App using Swift, Core ML, Core Image, ARKit, and OpenAI API. Each step includes a test to validate correct implementation.

Priority: Complete implementation as soon as possible.

1. Set Up Project Environment

Steps:

- Create a new Xcode project using Swift and UIKit.
- Set minimum iOS deployment target to iOS 15.0 (targeting iPhone 12 and newer).
- Enable camera permissions in Info.plist.
- Add dependencies via Swift Package Manager:
  - ARKit
  - CoreML
  - Vision
  - RealityKit (for AR visualization)
  - OpenAI Swift package (for API integration)

Test:

✅ Run the app and ensure it launches without errors.

2. Implement Camera Functionality

Steps:

- Use AVCaptureSession to access the device camera.
- Implement a UIImagePickerController to allow users to take photos.
- Capture and display the photo in a UIImageView.
- Include image quality and resolution optimization.

Test:

✅ Take a photo and ensure it is displayed correctly on the screen.

3. Analyze Room Lighting from Image

Steps:

- Convert the image to grayscale using Core Image (CIFilter).
- Calculate the average brightness of the image.
- Define thresholds for low, medium, and high brightness.
- Implement zone detection to identify different lighting areas within the same photo.
- Display brightness levels to the user with visual indicators.

Test:

✅ Capture images in bright, medium, and dark rooms, and ensure the app correctly identifies the light levels.

4. OpenAI-Powered Plant Recommendations

Steps:

- Integrate the OpenAI API client into the app.
- Send processed images to OpenAI's Vision API for analysis.
- Craft effective prompts that ask for plant recommendations based on the detected light levels.
- Parse and display the API response with recommended plants to the user.
- Implement error handling and fallback options if the API is unavailable.

Test:

✅ Verify that the API suggests shade-loving plants for low light and sun-loving plants for high light.
✅ Test API response time and implement appropriate loading indicators.

5. Implement AR-Based Plant Visualization

Steps:

- Initialize ARKit and detect surfaces using ARSCNView.
- Create simple AR visualizations to represent different plant types (without requiring 3D models).
- Use colored markers or simple geometries to indicate optimal plant placement areas based on light levels.
- Allow users to interact with these AR indicators.

Test:

✅ Ensure the AR visualization appears on flat surfaces and responds to user gestures.

6. Save & Retrieve User Preferences

Steps:

- Use UserDefaults for simple preference storage.
- Allow users to save favorite plant recommendations.
- Implement history of room analyses and recommendations.

Test:

✅ Save plant recommendations, close the app, reopen it, and verify the recommendations are restored.

7. UI & Performance Optimization

Steps:

- Design a clean, modern, and intuitive UI with creative visual elements.
- Implement a cohesive color scheme and consistent design language.
- Create custom animations for transitions between app screens.
- Optimize image processing for fast analysis.
- Ensure smooth AR performance.
- Implement accessibility features (VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, etc.).

Test:

✅ Measure the app's frame rate in AR mode (should stay at 60 FPS).
✅ Ensure light analysis completes in under 2 seconds.
✅ Verify UI elements are properly sized and positioned across different iPhone models (12 and newer).

8. OpenAI API Integration Refinement

Steps:

- Implement API key storage in a secure manner (Keychain).
- Add a configuration screen for API settings.
- Optimize API usage to minimize token consumption.
- Implement caching of API responses to reduce redundant calls.

Test:

✅ Verify secure storage of API credentials.
✅ Test API fallback mechanisms when connectivity issues occur.

Next Steps (After Base Implementation)

Once the base functionality is working, the following enhancements can be added:

- Multiple room analysis capability
- Seasonal plant recommendations based on time of year
- Plant care reminders and notifications
- Social sharing of recommendations
- Voice control for hands-free operation

Final Validation

Before deployment, conduct extensive testing on different devices (iPhone 12, 13, 14) to ensure smooth performance across screen sizes and lighting conditions.

✅ Final test: Simulate different room conditions and validate plant suggestions in real-world scenarios.
