# Plantam Development Progress

## March 21, 2025

### Step 1: Set Up Project Environment (Completed)

In this step, we established the basic Xcode project structure for the Plantam iOS application:

- Created a new SwiftUI-based iOS project with a minimum deployment target of iOS 15.0 (for iPhone 12 and newer)
- Set up the basic project files including:
  - `PlantamApp.swift`: Main app entry point
  - `ContentView.swift`: Initial UI screen
  - `Info.plist`: Configuration file with camera permission
  - Assets and preview content
- Configured the Xcode project file (project.pbxproj)
- Added Package.swift with the required dependencies:
  - ARKit
  - CoreML
  - Vision
  - RealityKit
  - OpenAI Swift package

The project now has the minimum viable environment to begin implementing the core functionality. The app can be launched but currently only shows a welcome screen.

### Step 2: Implement Camera Functionality (Completed)

In this step, we implemented the camera functionality to allow users to take photos of their rooms:

- Integrated camera functionality using a UIKit-based approach via `UIViewControllerRepresentable`
- Implemented a reliable camera preview that properly displays the live camera feed
- Created a custom camera interface with:
  - Flash toggle button (auto/on/off modes)
  - Capture button for taking photos
  - Cancel button to dismiss the camera
  - Photo review screen with options to use or retake
- Added handling for camera permissions through Info.plist
- Set up proper camera session lifecycle management
- Configured the camera modal sheet with an adjustable height (700pt default with ability to expand)
- Ensured captured images are properly returned to the main view for display

Key challenges overcome:
- Fixed initial camera black/blank screen issues by implementing a direct UIKit approach
- Resolved file reference issues in Xcode by integrating all camera functionality into ContentView.swift
- Balanced memory usage by properly starting/stopping camera sessions at appropriate lifecycle points

The camera functionality is now fully working and provides a solid foundation for the next steps in the implementation plan. Users can take photos of their rooms which will later be analyzed for lighting conditions.

Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 3: Implement Room Lighting Analysis
