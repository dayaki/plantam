# Plantam Development Progress

## March 21, 2025

### Step 1: Set Up Project Environment (Completed)

In this step, we established the basic Xcode project structure for the Plantam iOS application:

- Created a new SwiftUI-based iOS project with a minimum deployment target of iOS 15.0 (for iPhone 12 and newer)
- Set up the basic project files including:
  - `PlantamApp.swift`: Main app entry point
  - `ContentView.swift`: Initial UI screen
  - `Info.plist`: Configuration file with camera permission
  - Assets and preview content
- Configured the Xcode project file (project.pbxproj)
- Added Package.swift with the required dependencies:
  - ARKit
  - CoreML
  - Vision
  - RealityKit
  - OpenAI Swift package

The project now has the minimum viable environment to begin implementing the core functionality. The app can be launched but currently only shows a welcome screen.

Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 2: Implement Camera Functionality after validation of Step 1.
