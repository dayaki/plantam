# Plantam Development Progress

## March 21, 2025

### Step 1: Set Up Project Environment (Completed)

In this step, we established the basic Xcode project structure for the Plantam iOS application:

- Created a new SwiftUI-based iOS project with a minimum deployment target of iOS 15.0 (for iPhone 12 and newer)
- Set up the basic project files including:
  - `PlantamApp.swift`: Main app entry point
  - `ContentView.swift`: Initial UI screen
  - `Info.plist`: Configuration file with camera permission
  - Assets and preview content
- Configured the Xcode project file (project.pbxproj)
- Added Package.swift with the required dependencies:
  - ARKit
  - CoreML
  - Vision
  - RealityKit
  - OpenAI Swift package

The project now has the minimum viable environment to begin implementing the core functionality. The app can be launched but currently only shows a welcome screen.

### Step 2: Implement Camera Functionality (Completed)

In this step, we implemented the camera functionality to allow users to take photos of their rooms:

- Integrated camera functionality using a UIKit-based approach via `UIViewControllerRepresentable`
- Implemented a reliable camera preview that properly displays the live camera feed
- Created a custom camera interface with:
  - Flash toggle button (auto/on/off modes)
  - Capture button for taking photos
  - Cancel button to dismiss the camera
  - Photo review screen with options to use or retake
- Added handling for camera permissions through Info.plist
- Set up proper camera session lifecycle management
- Configured the camera modal sheet with an adjustable height (700pt default with ability to expand)
- Ensured captured images are properly returned to the main view for display

Key challenges overcome:
- Fixed initial camera black/blank screen issues by implementing a direct UIKit approach
- Resolved file reference issues in Xcode by integrating all camera functionality into ContentView.swift
- Balanced memory usage by properly starting/stopping camera sessions at appropriate lifecycle points

The camera functionality is now fully working and provides a solid foundation for the next steps in the implementation plan. Users can take photos of their rooms which will later be analyzed for lighting conditions.

Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 3: Implement Room Lighting Analysis

### Step 3: Implement Room Lighting Analysis (Completed)

In this step, we implemented the room lighting analysis functionality to analyze photos and determine optimal plant placement:

- Created a `LightingAnalyzer` class that provides comprehensive lighting analysis:
  - Calculates overall brightness levels of images using Core Image filters
  - Identifies different lighting zones within a single image using a grid-based approach
  - Classifies lighting conditions into three categories: Low Light, Medium Light, and High Light
  - Generates visual overlays to highlight different lighting zones with color coding
  - Provides percentage breakdowns of lighting conditions across the room

- Implemented a `LightingAnalysisView` to display analysis results:
  - Shows the original image with an option to toggle visualization of lighting zones
  - Displays overall light level with appropriate icon and description
  - Shows light distribution with percentage bars for each light level
  - Provides initial plant recommendations based on the dominant light level
  - Includes placement tips for optimal plant positioning

- Integrated the lighting analysis into the main app flow:
  - Added an "Analyze Room Lighting" button after photo capture
  - Implemented background processing to avoid UI freezing during analysis
  - Created a smooth transition from photo capture to analysis results
  - Added loading indicators during the analysis process

Key technical implementations:
- Used Core Image filters (CIColorControls, CIAreaAverage) for brightness analysis
- Implemented custom UIGraphics drawing for zone visualization
- Created an enum-based system for light levels with associated metadata
- Used SwiftUI's ProgressView to show light distribution percentages

The lighting analysis functionality now provides users with detailed information about their room's lighting conditions, setting the foundation for personalized plant recommendations in the next step.

Next Steps:
- Proceed to Step 4: Implement OpenAI-Powered Plant Recommendations
